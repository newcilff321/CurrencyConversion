Cathay United Bank side project

I'm very sorry, because the project I'm working on is currently undergoing performance tuning and various optimization stages, and I have been working overtime every day, which leaves me with limited time and patience to work on side projects after work.

The project has not been executed to the best of its potential yet, and there are more opportunities for expansion and optimization. I can provide further explanation during the interview.

Regarding unit testing, I have relied heavily on a specialized QA team for a long time, which has left me lacking in certain related skills. However, I have used Mockito before, and if there are relevant frameworks and examples available, I can quickly pick them up. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find any good reference sources.

So I have prepared screenshots of local testing in this file - currencyTest.docx.
